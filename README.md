## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Iphone Notes

  This is app that I use daily for my to-do lists and other important information.
    - I love the minimalistic design and user expirience. There are no ads, no premium feaures, everything comes down to functionality.
    - Ability to add drawings, tables, photos, checkboxes is really convinient.
    - You can easily style the text by changing the size fonts and font decoration. It's very convinietnly located in the bottom of the screen, so you can focus on the writing and whenver you want omehting you just look down the screen.
    - Organizing notes is very convinient since you can create folders and name them.
    - Every feature in the Notes seems to be functional and just the right thing. I don't get distracted when writing in notes and easy navigation makes it really convinient to use daily.

- Duolingo

  I use it everyday to learn new languages.
  - Gamification makes the app addicting.
  - Pleasent design makes it very enjoyable to use.
  - I love voice to text feature, ability to see the calendar and repeat the words you had mistakes in.
